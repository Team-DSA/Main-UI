Feminism is a socio-political movement and ideology that advocates for the equality of all genders, particularly focusing on addressing and dismantling systemic inequalities and discrimination faced by women. It challenges traditional power structures, cultural norms, and institutional biases that perpetuate gender-based disparities in areas such as education, employment, healthcare, and personal freedom. Feminism is not monolithic; it encompasses diverse perspectives and movements, including intersectional feminism, which emphasizes the interconnectedness of race, class, sexuality, and other identities in shaping experiences of oppression. At its core, feminism seeks to create a world where individuals are free to pursue their potential and live with dignity, irrespective of societal gender expectations.
